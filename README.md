# Decision-Trees-and-Ensemble-Modelling
This project aims to analyze the relationship between various car features (like price, maintenance cost, doors, capacity, luggage boot size, and safety) and their overall evaluation level. By examining categorical data, we'll identify patterns and trends to understand how these features influence the final classification of a car's quality.
